# House Price Prediction using Machine Learning

This project predicts house prices using machine learning regression models.
It focuses on data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Project Workflow
1. Data loading and exploration
2. Data cleaning and preprocessing
3. Feature engineering
4. Model training (Linear Regression, Random Forest)
5. Model evaluation using RMSE and R² score

## Results
The Random Forest model achieved better performance compared to baseline regression models.

## Future Improvements
- Hyperparameter tuning
- Adding more features
- Deploying model using Flask
